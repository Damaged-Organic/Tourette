## 0.3.0 - Reloaded conversion algorithm

### Implemented enhancements:

* Now Tourette supports conversion for almost any language, due to enhanced algorithm.

### Known bugs:

* For now package is unable to convert inputs that require different input method, like Hangul or Anthy, due to possible bug in Atom itself (https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12682).
