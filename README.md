# Tourette Atom package

This package will help you to convert selected text symbols in Atom editor
from any language to English (that is, the Code) on QWERTY keyboard layout.

## Demonstration

## Purpose

Coders whose native language is not English often caught writing code (after chatting or whatever) in their fluent keyboard layout, resulting in few words (or even lines) of bollocks. This is rather annoying

Now instead of furiously hitting backspace and swearing like you've got Tourette's syndrome, just finish the statement, select it and press the hotkey combination - and your language symbols will get converted to English according to QWERTY keyboard layout.

## Installation

To install this package with Atom Package Manager:

```shell
apm install tourette
```

Alternatively just use Atom interface.

## Usage

Select some text in your editor and press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd> to convert it.
